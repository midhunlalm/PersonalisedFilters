Project: Personalised filters


Brief:
The main idea of this project demo was to enable users to personalise the filters that they use.
We have curated a couple of ways to achieve this.


1. Self Customisation

User can simply drag and drop the favourite filters to their accessible positions and we will show them in the updated order during the next visit onwards.
This could be very powerful feature as the control is completely with the user and he/she can customise on their own.

2. Auto Customisation

We let the users to use the filters they want and we track the usage of each filters and reorder them based on the frequency of usage.

For eg: If user applies the 1Day delivery filter 3 times and In-store filter once and TopRated filter twice, the order that will be shown to the user during the next visit of the page will be

1. 1Day Delivery

2. topRated

3. In-store
